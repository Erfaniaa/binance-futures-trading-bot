## Features

- You can run it fast and it's easy to use.
- This project can handle multiple strategies at the same time.
- There are no complexities and no database usage in this project. Even dependencies are a few.
- It's easy to modify and customize.
- It automatically stores recent candles that can be used for machine learning model input.
- You can read the code for educational purposes.
- You can be notified with Telegram messages

## Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Generate a Binance API key (with Futures access) and put it in `credentials.py`.
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `python3 init_indicators_dict.py`.
5. Run `python3 init_orders_dict.py`.
6. Run `python3 main.py`.

This will run an example bot on trading Bitcoin with 4 strategies simultaneously. 

## Config

To write custom bots you can:

- Set an initial indicators setting in `init_indicators_dict.py` (because we are handling indicators in the client side with pickle files).
- Set an initial orders setting in `init_orders_dict.py` (because we are handling orders in the client side with pickle files).
- Define new indicators in `indicators.py`.
- Define a new strategy in `main.py` (especially inside `is_it_time_to_open_long_position` and `is_it_time_to_open_short_position` functions).
- Config your bot settings in `config.py`.

**Note:** If you define any machine learning model, you can use `recent_prices_list` as its input.

**Warning:** Binance has a maximum limit of 10 take-profit and stop-loss open orders, therefore do not use more than 5 strategies at the same time.

## Telegram Config

1. Firstly, you need to create a Telegram bot, so talk to [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather).
2. Secondly, need to know your own Telegram user ID, so the bot will know who to send messages to. Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get this information.
3. Thirdly, you have to `/start` your bot. Open up a private message with your bot by searching its username, then hit the start button.
4. Finally, set `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and `TELEGRAM_USER_ID` in `credentials.py`, and `SEND_TELEGRAM_MESSAGE` in `config.py`.

## To-do

- Import modules, not variables.
- Use classes and make `main.py` smaller.
- Add more indicators to `indicators.py`.
- Find a better way to handle error codes.
- Unify get candles functions.
